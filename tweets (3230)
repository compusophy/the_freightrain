Haha,@long Exactly. I'm not that dumb haha. But the nano has an address for me to approve that is not the two I'm trying to transfer between. I believe it's the websocket intermediary address but I don't trust it. That's where I'm hung up.,@OzTheApe That's what I did. When I go to sign on the ledger it takes me to the ledger live app and this websocket 3rd party thing.,@long That's what I'm doing! But I need to approve on the nano, right?,@RealAriCrypto @hotlneblng_ I'm using OS to transfer but you still need to approve on the nano. That's the whole point of a hardware wallet.

In this case it's a websocket bridge.,@OzTheApe Exactly but the address I was asked to confirm on the nano s was something I have never seen. It must have to do with the websocket bridge. I rejected until I understand better.,@OzTheApe Me too,Anyway I can't even mutate my ape because of this. I'm not verifying an address I'm not aware of. This is a good diamond hand method. I can't touch anything in my ledger ever again. Haha,@OzTheApe Using my ledger. Transferring from ledger to hit wallet. You need to approve the transaction on the nano itself. That's what I mean.,Where do you mutate? I'm on the BAYC site.,@OzTheApe Yeah but you need to verify on your nano.,@buffalospace00 Yes that's what I mean. But the nano asked me to verify an address I didn't know. Is that right?,@Ape149 Me looking in the mirror https://t.co/iCM49EIXgF,@RealAriCrypto Which is what I have. Ledger live pulled up the 3rd party BS. I rejected.,So transferring a nft from my cold wallet to my hot one requires me to use a 3rd party wallet (Websocket)?

Serious question.,@chrisdevlin7700 I said imagine 10-20 years.,It's not hard to figure out what your mutant will look like.,These are good profile pics for Halloween am I right? But that's about it.,@boredape5079 Don't make a rash decision. I'm waiting to see how this shakes out. Serum will become expensive in 10-20 years.,Think 10-20 years down the road. Imagine having the ape and the unused serum on the market. People would pay big to be able to mutate that far in the future. Use your big brain people. I might not do this by the way cuz I'm a degen.,@chrisdevlin7700 I'm not in a rush.,@boredape5079 Thanks. Any good in waiting to mutate?,@RDM_41 @CmdrKJB M1 art isn't great but M2 is pretty good.
